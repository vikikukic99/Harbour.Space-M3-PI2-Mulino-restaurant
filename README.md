Mulino Restaurant-Website using JavaScript, HTML, CSS


In the project, the following has been completed:

1) Home page:
   - Links for navigating to other pages (menu, join our team, social media, useful links, news)
     - Social media: Only the Instagram page is used, which is linked to the Instagram website.
     - Useful links: "About this website" and "Contact us" are pages with new windows with additional information.
     - News: I added a new text label where I put text inside it, which disappears when you start typing in the field.
               - The submit field does not work.
